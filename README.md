# cracking-the-coding-interview
solutions to CtCI problems

## STEPS
1. `ask for clarification of the problem`
  - make sure you have a complete understanding of the problem
  - __ask: what the input is, the return data should be, __
    - ex. if input data is integer or floating point values, are negative integers allowed, 
  - __create an example: working case + failure cases__
2. `think out loud of ideas`
  - __don't go to coding YET__
  - __think out of the possible solutions first__ (it doesn't have to be the best; just workable)
  - take time to interact with interviewer (+ hints) and come up w/ solution that interviewer approves to proceed in coding
  - __listen to the interviewer!!__ (if interviewer gives direction, take the hint!)
3. write code
4. `test code solution`
  - __test the examples made in the beginning__
  - think about __edges cases__
