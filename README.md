# cracking-the-coding-interview
solutions to CtCI problems

## STEPS

### 1. Clarification
1. `ask for clarification of the problem`
    - make sure you have a complete understanding of the problem
    - __ask: what the input is, the return data should be, etc__
      - ex. if input data is integer or floating point values, are negative integers allowed, 
2. `create examples`: 
    - __create working case__
    - __create failure cases__
    
### 2. Brainstorm Ideas
- `think out loud of ideas`
  - __don't go to coding YET__
  - __think out of the possible solutions first__ (it doesn't have to be the best; just workable)
  - take time to interact with interviewer (+ hints) and come up w/ solution that interviewer approves to proceed in coding
  - __listen to the interviewer!!__ (if interviewer gives direction, take the hint!)
  
### 3. Write Code

### 4. Test Solution
- `test code solution`
  - __test the examples made in the beginning__
- think about `edges cases`
